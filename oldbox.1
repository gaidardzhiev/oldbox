.TH OLDBOX 1 "July 2025" "Oldbox 1.0" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
    oldbox \- a modular collection of standalone *nix utilities

.SH SYNOPSIS
    oldbox [command] [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
    Oldbox is a suite of essential *nix command line utilities implemented as
    individual standalone binaries, in contrast to BusyBox which bundles many 
    utilities into a single static binary. This modular design offers fine grained
    control over installation, customization, and maintenance of each tool.

    Each utility is compiled separately rather than combined into one executable,
    promoting modularity, simplicity, and ease of maintenance. Oldbox utilities
    aim to preserve POSIX compatibility and minimal dependencies, making the suite
    ideal for lightweight or embedded *nix environments.

.SH INCLUDED UTILITIES
    The following utilities are included in Oldbox (each as an individual binary):

    basename     - strip file name affixes
    cp           - copy or move files
    echo         - print arguments
    kill         - terminate a process
    ln           - create links between files
    mount        - mount a filesystem
    nice         - execute a utility at altered scheduling priority
    printf       - format and print data
    rev          - reverse lines characterwise
    sleep        - suspend execution for a specified interval
    sync         - commit filesystem caches to disk
    tee          - pipe fitting; duplicate input to output and files
    touch        - set modification date of a file
    true         - do nothing successfully
    tty          - print terminal file name connected to stdin
    umount       - unmount filesystem
    wc           - display line, word, and character counts
    yes          - output a string repeatedly until killed
    tr           - transliterate data stream
    cat          - concatenate files and print to stdout
    shell        - simple command line shell
    pwd          - print current directory path
    ps           - process status information
    grep         - global regular expression print
    du           - estimate file space usage
    rm           - remove files
    ascii2hex    - convert ASCII to hexadecimal representation
    hexdump      - display file content in hex
    false        - do nothing unsuccessfully
    replace      - regular expression pattern matching and substitution
    readelf      - display information about ELF files
    strings      - print sequences of printable characters
    ls           - list directory contents
    xoda         - dump files in hex, octal, decimal or ASCII
    id           - print real and effective user and group IDs
    cmp          - compare files byte by byte
    tree         - list directories in tree like format
    kmsg         - print kernel ring buffer messages
    file         - determine file type by magic bytes
    magic        - inspect magic signature bytes in files
    mem          - print memory layout of a process
    test         - evaluate conditional expressions; returns 0 if true, 1 if false
    clear        - clear the terminal screen
    oldbox       - simple command dispatcher for the utilities
    lsblk        - list block devices
    bundle       - bundle files into a POSIX shell script archive

.SH MOTIVATION
    Oldbox was created to address these goals:

    - Modularity: install and update only the tools needed
    - Simplicity: easier development and maintenance of isolated utilities
    - Avoid symlink or argv dispatching complexity typical in single binary solutions
    - POSIX Compatibility: tools try to behave similarly to standard *nix commands

.SH BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
    To build and install oldbox:

        git clone https://github.com/gaidardzhiev/oldbox
        cd oldbox
        ./build_toolchain.sh
        make
        make install

    After installation, each utility is accessible as an individual executable.
